# The Odin Project's Calculator

Hey there! This is a Microsoft-inspired calculator made for the Odin Project.

I'm quite happy with the logic, as I used a non-common approach in this kind of project, that best suited my way of thinking. 
 

Initially I was going to make an inverse function, but I could not figure it out properly so I ditched it. 
I had to completely revamp this project two times, but I'm happy with the end result.

Anyways, feel free to criticise, hope you enjoy!

## version 2

I bugfixed using the feedback from TOP Discord user Fiddle (https://github.com/Fiddle-N):
